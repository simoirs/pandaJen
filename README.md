A code generator targeted to Spring Boot's REST Api.
Type in the class name and it generates:

- Repository
- Service
- Controller

complete with the most used methods and an empty stub for the ones that need the actual class variables, like "update".

It is not perfect, there's still work to do, but it's already a time saver for any start of a project.
